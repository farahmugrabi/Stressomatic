## Disclaimer

</div>

This tool is for information purposes only. It does **not** replace a full assessment of the financial resilience of individual institutions. Its inference is limited, as it relies solely on past EBA stress test data and an econometric approach, and therefore cannot substitute for a full balance-sheet modelling framework.

This tool provides a quick assessment of banks’ financial resilience to any macroeconomic scenario, by leveraging the outcomes of past EBA EU-wide stress tests (2014–2025).

The framework is based on the methodology developed by Q. Bro de Comères and F. Mugrabi, *“A Quick Stress Testing Framework for European Banks”*, forthcoming in the *International Journal of Central Banking* (202_). Users are kindly requested to cite this paper when using the tool, its methodology, or any results, data, and/or analyses derived from it.

The **EBA** and **CRR3** worksheets provide visualisation tools for:

- EBA stress test results (2010–2025), and  
- the impact of the finalisation of CRR3 on banks’ starting CET1 ratios (using 2025 data).

Then, the serious part begins…

To run the framework, you need a working installation of **R** or **RStudio**.

At a high level, when you click the **“Stress Me!”** button, the R script `Stress-O-Matic.R` is opened and must be run to completion. For any comprehensive update of the framework beyond 2025, please contact the co-authors.

The framework consists of three main modules. Before running them, specify the folder path where this file is located in **cell G49 (step 4.)** — this ensures the script can correctly locate all necessary files in the framework structure.

## THE (OPTIONAL) SCENARIO GENERATION

</div>
</div>

**Step 1** (scenario generation) is optional. It can be skipped by setting **cell G13** to `"N"`. In that case, you can move directly to Step 2 and input your own scenario in the table (in growth rates, similar to EBA reporting). You do not need to provide values for all variables: any column left blank will be greyed out.

The scenario generation module produces an adverse scenario using two long-difference  
\((Y_{t+h} - Y_{t-1})\) local projection (LP) models at quarterly frequency, projecting over the next **12 quarters**:

- a **linear LP**, and  
- a **smooth-transition LP (STLP)**, where the transition variable reflects the leverage state of the economy.

In **cell M24**, you can select the specification: `"Linear"`, `"Low-leverage"`, or `"High-leverage"`.

The model generates a projected path for the selected credit cycle state of the economy in response to an exogenous *restrictive* monetary policy shock. It considers three endogenous variables — **real GDP**, **unemployment**, and **real residential real-estate prices** — and one interest rate variable (**1-year Euribor**).

You can control:

- **Number of lags** for endogenous variables: **cell G21**  
- **Number of lags** for the rate: **cell K21**  
- Whether to include **contemporaneous values** of these variables on the right-hand side: **cells G22 and K22**

The interest rate variable ensures that the scenario reflects a genuinely restrictive shock. You can calibrate its intensity by rescaling all impulse response functions (IRFs) via **cell G19**. For example, setting the scaling factor to 25 corresponds to a 25-basis-point (bp) increase in the 1-year Euribor on impact.

You must also specify the estimation sample:

- Start and end **years** in **cells E28 and E29** (e.g. 2000–2025)
- Corresponding **quarters** in **cells F28 and F29** (values between 1 and 4)

### Identification of the monetary policy shock

In **cell G15**, you can choose how to identify the monetary policy shock:

- `"OLS"`: the shock is included directly among the regressors  
- `"IV"`: the shock is used to instrument the 1-year Euribor

The restrictive exogenous shock is a monetary policy factor extracted from monetary policy surprises, following Altavilla et al. (2019). In **cell G17**, three factors are available:

- `"Target"` factor (policy rate)  
- `"Path"` factor (forward guidance)  
- `"QE"` factor (quantitative easing)

These factors load on different maturities (e.g. the Target factor mainly affects the 1-month Euribor, while the QE factor mainly affects 5- and 10-year rates). In addition, option `"JK"` allows you to use the factors extracted by Jarociński and Karadi (2020).

In **cell K17**, you can specify whether the shock should be corrected for its information component:

- `"Raw"`: original factor  
- `"MP"`: “pure” monetary policy shock  
- `"CBI"`: information (central bank information) shock  

Finally, in **cell K13**, you must specify the **country**
